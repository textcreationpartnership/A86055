            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT was no inconſiderable or left-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth, that the Lyrick Poet inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly maintained, — <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. That in every thing or action, Seaſonable performance is a principal matter. And the Excellently learned and Philoſophical Emperour, <hi>M. Anton. (Lib. 12. Sect. 35.)</hi> lays it down as a fixed Poſition or Maxime — <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. That that only is good, which is ſeaſonable.</p>
                  <p>Whether this my preſent Diſcourſe, may come into the world ſeaſonably, I will not ſay, or take on me to determine; yet have I ſome reaſon to judge and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it may: for, if I conſider, and compare the complexion of the times, with the ſubject matter of this Book, I find them equally Prodigious; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon— <q>
                        <l>A Book of Prodigies is fit,</l>
                        <l>In times Prodigious to be writ.</l>
                     </q>

                  <pb facs="tcp:114880:5"/>
                  <p>The order of Nature now, (as in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> time, <hi>Ap. Cap. 20.</hi>) is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Monſters and Prodigies. And the ſeveral Prodigious Actions performed lately, and now on foot in most parts of the world, ſpeak the times disturbance, and the unſetledneſs of the brains and humors of men. Every Poſt (almoſt) brings news of ſome Protean Change.</p>
                  <p>But it is the trumpet of time that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can proclaim its ſeaſonableneſs, or intempeſtivity: The breath of which, doth either blaſt the credit, or blazon the worth of all Books.</p>
                  <p>I have not troubled my ſelf, or been at any large coſts or expences upon it, for its journey into the world; but have truſted unto it, to beſpeak its own entertainment, according to its merit. The Fate of it (I foreſee) will be, not much unlike its Author's; that is, it will meet with cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of all ſorts, as he with men.</p>

I have run through the bulk of it, in almost as ſtrange a manner, as ſome of our (now-adays) Christians, their forms of Religion! or the furious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt his viſions and Revelations.

                        <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> or earthly Prodigies are many; As, for a man to be born with ſix fingers and toes on each hand and foot, <hi>Goliah</hi>-like: Or, <hi>twins</hi> to be brought forth joyned together, as in the yeer 1475. neer <hi>Verona</hi> one was (or rather two w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or for one to be born with a <hi>head bigger then all the rest of his body;</hi> as in the year 1581. at <hi>Chicheſter</hi> in <hi>England</hi> in the County of <hi>Suſſex.</hi> Or for a birth to be <hi>two perfect bodies from the Navel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and to have <hi>hands and feet,</hi> and all members elſe <hi>proportionable for two,</hi> only joyned at the Navel, and have their legs iſſue out thence; as in the yeer 1552. at <hi>Middleton in Oxfordſhire</hi> it hapned, as is recorded by <hi>Stow in his Abridgement.</hi> Or for children to be born any otherwayes monſtrous or miſhapen, as <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Mizaldus, Peucer,</hi> &amp;c. teſtifie of many ſuch births; unto whoſe works I refer the curious Reader.</p>
                     <p>Then for children to ſpeak in their <hi>Mothers womb,</hi> or <hi>laugh</hi> or <hi>cry</hi> there; as in <hi>Marucina</hi> a child in his Mothers belly was heard to cry; and in <hi>Kent</hi> in <hi>England</hi> a

Or for a child <hi>of ſix months old to ſpeak,</hi> as in the yeer of the world 3725. one was heard at <hi>Rome</hi> at that age to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a Triumph. And in the year of the world 3417. when <hi>Cyrus</hi> overcame in battel <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of the <hi>Lydians,</hi> a child of ſix Months old is ſaid to have diſtinctly foretold in a prodigious and wonderful manner, <hi>That his Kingdom ſhould be loſt.</hi> For <hi>Dogs, Serpents, Oxen, Cows,</hi> &amp;c. to ſpeak diſtinctly, as to <hi>Tarquinius</hi> once a Dog ſpake very articulately, and a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent alſo.

                     <p>I come in the next place to ſpeak of the kinds of Celeſtial Prodigies; and they are many alſo.

                        </hi> as ſaith Dr. <hi>B.</hi> in his Doom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſame Author tells us, that in the year 930. <hi>poſt Chriſtum,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Then for <hi>Caſtles, Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns, to be</hi> repreſented in the Air as if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>fixed there.</hi> And for whole Countreys to be, and appear in the Heavens, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along in them <hi>Hills, Woods, Valleys, Rivers, Beaſts, Fowls, Men, Women</hi> and <hi>Children,</hi> and all as variouſly and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently diſpoſed, as they are really and certainly known to be on earth. Thus Dr. <hi>Fulke</hi> in his diſcourſe of Meteors. For <hi>Monſtrous and hideous ſhapes</hi> to appear in the Heavens, ſuch as the earth affords no ſimilitude: Such as <hi>Livius</hi> ſaith appeared at <hi>Rome, Anno Mundi</hi> 3696. he reporteth them (for want of fit and convenient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of them among men) to be both ill-favoured, and cruel.</p>
                     <p>Then, for <hi>Burials, Proceſſions, Judgments, Combates, Weapons of all ſorts, Crowns</hi> and

                        <hi>Scepters, Arms of certain Countreys and Noble-men;</hi> For the Images and ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of men to appear like penitential patients, after an humble and repentant manner, asking forgiveneſs of whom they have offended.

                     <p>Then for the Similitudes or likeneſs of perſons known to the Spectators, to appear in the Heavens; as that of the Emperour <hi>Charls,</hi> unto whom the Spectators did obeiſance (ſuppoſing it to have been him in reality) by putting off their Caps unto him.

                     </p>
                     <p>And I very well remember, that in the yeer 1649. the very yeer in which <hi>Charls late King of England was beheaded, it was generally</hi> (I will not, I cannot ſay truly) <hi>reported, that he, without his head, was ſeen to hover in the Air over White-hall</hi> (the

                     </p>
                     <p>Again, had it been a New Star, and

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (i. e.) <hi>behold, there came wiſe men,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee the wiſe men had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being directed by the Star alone. And hence it was that <hi>Gregory the Great</hi> obſerved an admirable convenience in Gods directing of them by it, above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Becauſe that perſons of meaner knowledge and parts are tied both by the Laws of Reaſon, Nature and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to give credence to thoſe that do
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114880:23"/> excel;</hi> and by this means Chriſts coming would be noted the more, and believed the ſooner; whereas if any of meaner parts ſhould have reported the ſame, it is more then probable, it would have been the more ſlighted, and the leſſer believed. The learned <hi>Gregory</hi>'s words are theſe.— <hi>Deus accommodatè ad eorum ſcientiam docuit, ut qui in ſtellarum obſervatione verſabantur ex ſtellis Christum diſcerent. Very fitly, and conveniently did God enable the knowledge of thoſe wiſe men, that they (alone) ſhould learn Chriſt from the Stars, who were verſed in the obſervation of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This may be aſpected as a digreſſion. However, it reſults, <hi>that when God makes uſe of Prodigies, he doth not neglect the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue he firſt impreſt on Nature, but rather augmenteth, and further adorneth it</hi> (by his acting it thus prodigiouſly and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily) <hi>with far greater honour and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency;</hi> as the Suns appearing, doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh or put out the leſſer light of the Moon and Stars, but ſwallows them up by a more eminent and illuſtrious ſplendor. <hi>Prodigies and Apparitions, have therefore a Natural cauſe;</hi> and God doth, and may, make them the fore-runners of his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114880:23"/> and eſpecial intents and purpoſes; and yet act them in a courſe of Nature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though above, or beyond the ordinary and common courſe thereof.</p>
                     <p>For if Prodigies ſhould proceed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, and have no ground or footing in Nature; it would roundly follow, <hi>that God ſhould ceaſe to work by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,</hi> and conſequently neglect the chain of Nature, or ſecond cauſes: but it is plain, God doth not neglect the uſe of Nature (neither doth he withdraw that certain and ſecret power wherewith he firſt endowed Nature) for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing and bringing to paſs of his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt deſigns; no more then a Prince or Emperor neglects his Laws and Statutes unrepealed, when he hath an occaſion to make uſe of them. Howbeit, this doth no way exclude God from being the chief cauſe of Prodigies (as I have formerly urged) no more then a Prince who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates a Perſon of Honour under him, (and veſts him with power convenient) to reduce ſome Iſland, Plantation, or Countrey unto his obedience, can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from being the firſt and original cauſe of ſuch an undertaking.</p>
                     <p>Thus <hi>per modum eminentiae: By way of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114880:24"/> eminencie,</hi> God is the chief cauſe of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing; and this as he is <hi>primum ens, The firſt being of them:</hi> And as <hi>Sol &amp; homo generat hominem; The Sun and man begat man:</hi> So, <hi>Deus &amp; Natura gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Prodigia; God and Nature contribute to the begetting and producing Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Sun with his vivifying Beames, doth cauſe the Earth to fructifie and bring forth, and ſo by conſequence is the eſſential cauſe of all vegetables, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Deus eſt cauſa eſſentialis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God is the eſſential cauſe of Apparitions and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies: Sed natura eſt cauſa Materialis; But Nature is the material cauſe of them:</hi> For, from her pregnant womb they all ſpring, and in her womb they are all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. Yea, ſhe is <hi>cauſa formalis</hi> alſo; it is ſhe alone that like a prudent Artificer, or Builder, faſhioneth and formeth them: So that the formal cauſe of Prodigies is Natures fee-ſimple, and ſhe cannot be robbed thereof.</p>
                     <p>For as the Schoolmen teach, <hi>Deus ipſe non poteſt ſupplere vicem cauſae formalis,</hi> (i.e.) <hi>God himſelf (ſay they) cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the place, or ſtead of a formal cauſe:</hi> Yet (as I before ſhewed) he is by way of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114880:24"/> eminencie the cauſe of every thing. As in natural or humane generation, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more worthy then the Son, and the Root more excellent then the Branch: So here in the production of Prodigies, <hi>God being both the Father, and the Root, muſt be highly ſuppoſed to be a cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely and eminently beyond the Nature of them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And therefore it is that the ſchool-men teach again, <hi>Quod eſt cauſa cauſae, eſt etiam cauſa cauſati.</hi> (i. e.) <hi>That which is the cauſe of the cauſe, is the cauſe alſo of what is cauſed by the cauſe.</hi> So then, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Original and Father of Nature her ſelf, it will follow <hi>(ſine dubio)</hi> that he is alſo, in an eminent and tranſcendent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Father and Original cauſe of all and every of Natures Products. For if God (as Divines ſpeak) be <hi>(cauſa cauſarum,) the cauſe of all cauſes;</hi> we muſt of neceſſity (not only ſuppoſe, but) grant, that he is the cauſe of all the effects cauſed by thoſe cauſes.</p>
                     <p>This being then, both in a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical and Divine ſence true, and ſo gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and taken; yet <hi>Natura eſt cauſa inſtrumentalis:</hi> If we will give Nature her proper birth-right and due, we muſt then
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114880:25"/> acknowledge her to be the only inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental cauſe, and the bringer of Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies forth. It therefore freely follows, and that by ſufficient proof, <hi>That Prodigies have a Natural cauſe.</hi> And ſo I deſcend unto my third Queſtion.</p>

                     <p>But firſt, note that many of the things mentioned in the Column of Effects,

And let the Reader underſtand, that although I have appropriated thoſe many and ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of Countries unto the ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies hapning therein, yet I deny not the Co-operation of the Coeleſtial bodies therewith, according to the ſtrength of their configurations, in the production of ſuch rare and admirable Effects.</p>

And 2. to ſtrengthen the weaker fancy, who is often found willing to be wading in Rivers of this Nature, that he may not in ſtead of refreſhing, drown himſelf.</p>

                           <p>Others there are, that judge a Comet not to be any thing real and diſtinct from other pre-exiſtent bodies; but rather a meer Emphaſis or apparency, made by the reflection or refraction of Solar and Lunar Rays.

                           <p>The colours of Comets are much to be noted in their ſignifications and portents, as the writings of the Antients teſtifie at large; but their opinions hereof are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral.</p>
                           <p>Some there are that hold that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of Comets are principally three, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. If the matter of which they conſiſt be rare and thin, then are they tranſparent, cleer, and of colour white. 2. If their ſubſtance be thick and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Aſtrologers generally hold that there are Comets of ſeven ſeveral colours, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the number and colour of the ſeven Planets, <hi>viz.</hi> —</p>

                           <p>Firſt, Comets are or may be ſent for a Natural or Phyſical end, that they may by their attractive ſtrengths and vertues draw up the ſpirits, breathings and peſtiferous winds, which are gathered together from Metallique liquors in the Earth, into the air, from the common ſeat and place of mankinde, that thereby we may partake the leſs of their malice. For (ſaith one) by being burnt out, and conſumed there, they are the leſs able to hurt us, then if they were below. And if they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Earth (as ſometimes they do) they would then rend and ſhake it; or if they ſhould remain in the neer neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air, they would infect or poyſon us ſooner, then by their being above: For if the air be infected when they are on high, and a great way from us, much more would it be infected, ſhould they be below and neer us.</p>
                           <pb n="99" facs="tcp:114880:57"/>
                           <p>Secondly, They may be ſent for a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical end; and in this reſpect, they are taken for heralds or proclaimers of future calamities and miſeries; that men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by being fore-warned, may be fore-armed, and provided, either to ſhun the threatned diſaſter or miſchief, or elſe with patience and moderation endure the common and inevitable miſery. It is a moſt certain truth, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>. Never yet did any Comet appear, but it was the meſſenger or declarer of ſome evil. They are ordinarily the prenuntiators of the death of Princes, Plague and Famine of the people (which things in the body politick, are as the bleeding a vein in the body natural) alſo Wars, Inundations, Earthquakes and Tempeſts.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of their Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal end, I agree with that learned Authour Dr. <hi>Swan,</hi> that they are either a ſign of calamity, or elſe the efficient cauſe of them. If a ſign of calamity, then their end is to be Monitors, Inſtigators, and admoniſhers to repentance. But if they be the efficient cauſe of miſery and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, then are they ſent as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of puniſhing ſome ſuch enormous malice and contumacy, as would not be
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114880:58"/> kept under, or reſtrayned by any humane law or device whatſoever.</p>
                           <p>Moſt true it is, That Comets (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all prodigies) were always looked upon, as the threatning eyes of divine vengeance, or the tongue of an ireful and greatly offended Deity. The learned Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt <hi>Pliny,</hi> tells us, that a Comet is a terrible Star, for the moſt part, and is not e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thus much for the end of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets.</p>

                           <p>The Eclipſe of the Sun is cauſed by the interpoſition of the opacous and dark body of the Moon between the Sun and our ſight; which for a ſeaſon obſcureth or hideth the light of the Sun from our ſight. Now this only falleth out at a new Moon, or when the Sun and Moon are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction. But you muſt know that it is not every time the Luminaries are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, that the Sun ſuffers an eclipſe; but when the Conjunction happens within the limits, or ordinary boundaries of an Eclipſe. And they are chiefly theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—</p>
                           <p>Firſt, if the apparent latitude of the Moon, at the time of the viſible Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction exceed 34. <hi>min.</hi> 51. <hi>ſec.</hi> the Sun at that time cannot be Eclipſed.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, when the mean motion of the Moons latitude, at the middle time of the Conjunction of the Sun and Moon, is diſtant from the North Node (which the

                           <p>Firſt, by reaſon of the inequality or difference of her latitude, which in ſome Eclipſes is nothing at all, and then the Eclipſe is greater, and of longer continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or duration.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, when the latitude of the Moon is ſo great, that ſhe falleth but little within the ſhadow of the Earth, and by conſequence comes to ſuffer the ſmaller Eclipſe. You are to underſtand, that as the Sun is not ſubject to an Eclipſe every time he is in Conjunction of the Moon; ſo
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114880:60"/> the Moon is not capable of ſuffering a defect or want of light every time ſhe is in oppoſition of the Sun. But if you would know when the Moon ſhall ſuffer an Eclipſe, and when not, obſerve theſe two rules.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, if the latitude of the full Moon be leſs then the ſum of the Semidiameters of the Moon and the earths ſhadow, the Moon may then ſuffer an Eclipſe; but if her latitude be greater, ſhe cannot at that full Moon be eclipſed.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if the middle place of the Moon ſhall be diſtant from either her North or South Node, (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons Head or Tayl) leſs then 15. <hi>d.</hi> 12. <hi>m.</hi> ſhe may at that oppoſition ſuffer an eclipſe.

                           <p>Divers are the opinions of Philoſophers concerning the kindes of Earthquakes; for there are ſome that hold there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven kinds of them; others, but five; ſome others, but four: and the learned <hi>Ariſtotle, de Meteor. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. maketh only two Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of them, <hi>viz. tremor &amp; pulſus;</hi> a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and a beating. But among all theſe opinions, that which admits of five ſeveral kinds or Species, ſeemeth to carry the moſt apparent ſhew of reaſon, there being a manifeſt and apparent difference between each of them; and accordingly I ſhall give you a deſcription of each of them; and they thus follow: —</p>
                           <p n="1">1. The firſt kinde of Earthquake, is a lateral or ſide-long ſhaking; as when the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114880:70"/> whole force or fury of the wind driveth to one place only, there being no contrary motion to let or hinder it. Many Hills and Buildings have been ruſhed down by this kind of Earthquake, eſpecially when the wind cauſing it, was fierce and ſtrong; for if it happen to be a weak and feeble wind, it only looſneth or unfaſtneth the foundations; but if it be leſs weak, then without further harm, the Earth only ſhakes like one ſick of an ague.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The ſecond kind is not ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral or ſide-long, as perpendicular, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; and happeneth when the earth with great violence is ſo lifted up, that the buildings thereof are likely to fall; and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly it ſinketh down again: for after the wind or vapour that cauſed the earth to ſwell, is broke out of its priſon, the earth returneth to its old place, even as it was before.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The third kind of Earthquake is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hyatus,</hi> a gaping, rending or cleaving of the earth; one part thereof being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo far from the other, that whole Towns, Cities, Rivers, Hills, Rocks and Seas, and the like, are ſwallowed up, and never ſeen again; like unto that which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the year 244. <hi>poſt Chriſtum.</hi>

The fourth kind of Earthquake is a ſhaking that cauſeth ſinking, and is far differing from the former; for now the Earth ſplitteth not, but ſinketh; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in ſuch places, where though the ſurface or upper parts of the earth be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and firm, yet the foundation thereof is but ſalt; which being moiſtened by water, being driven through it by the force of the ſhaking exhalation, is turned to water al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.

                           <p n="5">5. The fifth and laſt kind of Earthquakes is different from the former: for as before the ground ſinks down, ſo now it is caſt up; ſomewhat like to the ſecond kind mentioned; only with this difference, that now it returneth not to its place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, but remaineth a very great Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; like unto that of <hi>Mercley</hi> Hill in <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire</hi> which happened about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſince, as is mentioned at the begining of this book.</p>

                           <p>As for the <hi>Antecedentia,</hi> or the ſigns and fore-runners of Earthquakes, according to the beſt of Authors, they are chiefly theſe which follow.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. A great Calmneſs, Tranquillity, and ſerenety of the Air, intermixed with ſome cold: the reaſon of which is, becauſe the exhalation which ſhould be blowing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, is wholly within the Earth.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The dimneſs and paleneſs of the Sun, for certain days together, although there be no clouds to interpoſe. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe the wind which ſhould have diſſolved and purged the groſs Air, is taken captive, and kept and encloſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bowels of the earth.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. A more then ordinary quietude and ſolitarineſs of birds <hi>(i. e.)</hi> if they do not flie, but ſit ſtill, and are fearful to let any come neer unto them: the reaſon of which is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe either the pent exhalation ſendeth ſome ſtrange alteration in the Air, which ſlenderly breatheth out of the inſenſible pores of the earth; which it may do, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the exhalation tarry behind: or
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114880:71"/> elſe it is by reaſon they are ſcarce able to flie for want of ſome gentle gales for their wing (as they flie) to ſtrike upon; it being a thing well known, that birds flie more cheerfully and willingly when the Air is of ſuch a temper.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. When the weather of it ſelf is calm, and yet the water of the Sea is troubled, and rageth mightily: and the reaſon that is given of this, is, becauſe the great plenty of ſpirits or wind in the bottom of the Sea, begins to labor for paſſage that way; but finding none, is ſent back again: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it ſoon after ſhaketh the land: and this, ſaith Dr. <hi>Swan,</hi> is evermore a certain ſign.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. When the water in the bottom of pits and deep wells is troubled, aſcending and moving as if it were boyled; ſtinking, and is infected: the reaſon whereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the exhalation being pent, and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to get forth, moveth ſome ſtinking minerals and other poyſonous ſtuff to the Springs of theſe waters; and they with the ſtrugling exhalation do ſtir and attaint them.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. When a long thin cloud is ſeen in a clear skie, either a little before Sun ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or ſoon after: and this is cauſed by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114880:72"/> reaſon of the calmneſs of the Air; even as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth, that in a quiet Sea, the Waves float to the ſhore long and ſtraight.</p>
                           <p n="7">7. The ſeventh and laſt Sign, and that which cannot but be infallible, is the great noiſe and ſound which is heard under the Earth, much like to thunder or hideous groanings. But yet ſome ſay, that this is not always attended with an Earthquake; for if the wind find any way large enough to get out, it ſhaketh not the Earth. And thus much ſhall ſerve for the <hi>Antecedentia</hi> of Earthquakes.</p>

                           <p>And now the <hi>Conſequentia,</hi> or effects of Earthquakes, are principally theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, the ruine of Buildings, and the death and deſtruction of many people; and the like: as appears at large by the Chronologies of <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Lanquet;</hi> alſo by <hi>Tacitus, lib.</hi> 2. and <hi>Fromundus, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Meteor.</hi> The Examples whereof are ſo many and ſo numerous, that to recite them here again, were to add another Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie.

                           <p>Secondly, the turning of plain grounds into Mountains, as that of <hi>Marcly</hi> Hill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; and the raiſing up of Iſlands in the Sea; as <hi>Thia</hi> in the time of <hi>Pliny;</hi> and <hi>Theraſia,</hi> which as <hi>Seneca</hi> witneſſeth, was made an Iſland even in the ſight of the Mariners, or whilſt they were looking on.

                           <p>Thirdly, the throwing down, or levelling of Mountains, and ſinking of Iſlands and other ground: and thus periſhed by the breach of the earth, thoſe famous Cities of <hi>Achaia, Helice</hi> and <hi>Buris;</hi> of which <hi>Ovid</hi> thus writeth. —</p>

                           <p>Fourthly, the driving away, or the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the neck of ſome <hi>Iſthmus</hi> from the Continent.

                           <p>Sixthly, the breaking out of Rivers and Fountaines in ſome new places; which happeneth by the breaches made in the earth amongſt water-ſprings, through the violence of the exhalation.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly, great winds and tempeſts, manifeſt changes and diverſities of the times; infection of the Air, and all that breath in it, chiefly of ſuch creatures that look downward: for the infection is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the poyſonous fume of the exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114880:73"/> aſcending upward. For putrid and Poyſonous exhalations infect the Air, and the Air us; according to <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:</hi> beſides, <hi>Hieronym.

                           <p>Eighthly, the wrath and terror of an angry and highly diſpleaſed Deity; who is every whit as much honoured by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king men to tremble and fear before him, as by his greateſt acts of mercy and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency. For it was his reſolution of old, in <hi>Leviticus, chap.</hi> 26. <hi>verſ.</hi> 27, 28. <hi>Quod ſi hac ratione non auſcultaveritis mihi, ſed ambulaveritis mecum temerè, uti<expan>

For, ſaith he, a vapor is a certain watry ſubſtance or thing, and yet not water: And a fume hath and doth retain a certain earthy quality in it, but yet is not earth. And this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction may be modeſtly admitted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Antient rule,— <hi>Fumus eſt mediae naturae inter terrum &amp; ignem; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por vero inter aquam &amp; aërem.</hi> (i.e.) A fume is of a middle Nature or quality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween earth and fire; but a vapour is of a middle Nature between water and Air.

But fumes are bodies or ſubſtances hot and dry, like unto the ſmoak, and are by nature thinner and lighter then vapors; for vapors are never attracted or drawn up above the middle Region of the Air; for that the cold Air there, by thickning and conglomerating them, preſently turns them into clouds: and thence proceeds Miſts, Rains, Snows, Hayls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now fumes aſcend &amp; paſs the loweſt and middle Region of the Air, and are carryed up even into the higheſt Region: And there by reaſon of their exceſſive heat, and neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto the fire, they are kindled, and admit of and receive divers fiery impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and being of a viſcous and clammy nature and ſubſtance, and diverſly diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they appear to thoſe that inhabit the Earth, like Dragons, Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>Sometimes theſe Meteors are generated after another manner: for the exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on being long and narrow, and by the heat of the upper Region is kindled at one end, and burning ſwiftly, the fire run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from one end to the other, as on a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114880:80"/> peece of waxed third that is lighted.</p>
                        <p>Others there are, that ſay this exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not ſo much ſet on fire, as that it is directly ſeated under ſome one ſtar in the Firmament in a direct line, (as it were) and ſo receiveth light from that Star, ſeeming to be a ſtar when it falls.</p>
                        <p>Now againſt this later opinion there are two cleer exceptions, the firſt whereof is this: It is moſt certain, that thoſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors ſhoot or fall as often obliquely, as perpendicular or down-right; and ſo I have ſeen them often to fall: Therefore it cannot receive its ſhining (as it is urged) from a Star.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond exception is this—In its fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, it appeareth to ſight much bigger then any fixed Star that is fixed in the eighth Sphear; (yea ſometimes bigger then <hi>Phoſphorus</hi> (as I have ſeen) which is the biggeſt to ſight of the ſeven Erratick Stars, and therefore is by ſome called <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114880:81"/> of a ſtar, it would at its greateſt diſtance from us appear leaſt full of light, as a ſtar in his Apogaeon or Aphaelion: And would ſhew it ſelf fulleſt of light when it doth approximate us; even as a ſtar in his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigaeon or Perihaelion: but we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to be apparently true; therefore it cannot be kindled this way: yet ſome have thought it might eaſily be demonſtrated.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Epicurus</hi> his Opinion touching this Meteor is, that the ſtars fall out of the Firmament, and that by the fall of them, both Thunder and Lightning is cauſed. For the Lightning (ſaith he) is nothing elſe but the ſhining of the ſtar that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; which falling into a watery cloud, and being quenched in it, cauſeth that great noyſe which is called Thunder; even as hot Iron maketh a noyſe by its being caſt into the water.</p>
                        <p>I ſhall not much queſtion this opinion of <hi>Epicurus;</hi> nor trouble my ſelf to play the Critique with him about it: Although the learned Phyſician and Philoſopher <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreas Argolus</hi> affords me good ground ſo to do, in <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>fol.</hi> 29. of his Epheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides; where he ſhews that the Sun and all the Planets are vaſt diſtances from the Firmament; yea, many millions of miles.</p>

                        <p>Yet I ſuppoſe, I may modeſtly demand of any holding this opinion, If the Orbs of the Erratique ſtars be ſo vaſt a diſtance from the Firmament, as <hi>Argol</hi> averreth, Why ſhould not the eighth Sphear, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sphear of the fixed ſtars, be at full as great a diſtance (if not greater) then them? (unleſs they conclude the eighth ſphear to be the firmament; which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they do not, becauſe it is contrary to the rules of Aſtronomy.) And if hence it ſhall be ſuppoſed that the fixed ſtars are any ſpace (be it little or much) diſtant from the firmament, why then ſhould any be ſo ridiculous, as to affirm that they may or do, fall from, or out of the firmament? But I ſhall paſs this over, and leave the diſcuſſion to abler Pens, and conclude with the divine Poet. —</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>I anſwer,</hi> The main cauſe why they lead men out of their way (if the phraſe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) is, becauſe thoſe ſilly wretches that ſee them, and pretend to be led by them, being ſore amazed, and aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ighted at them, (not knowing their true cauſe, you may be ſure) do look ſo earneſtly after them, that they forget their way. And then being never ſo little out of their road (and frighted withall) they wander they know not whither; ſometimes to Pits, Rivers, and other very dangerous and diſmal places. And when at the laſt they happen into their road again, and get home, (with their hair an end, and themſelves ſweating and ſtaring) they fall a telling their friends
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:114880:84"/> ſtrange and incredible ſtories, how that ſome devil or ſpirit in the likeneſs of fire, hath led them out of their way, I cannot (nor they neither very well, or truly) tell how far, or how long time; and that it came ſo neer them, it would have done them hurt, had not their prayers or ſome hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly cogitations (ſuch no doubt as ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed men are capable of) diverted it. When notwithſtanding, all this while, the great dangers thoſe poor ignorant wretches dread, is in the depravedneſs of their own ſenſes! for there is none to them outward at all.</p>
                        <p>Now, the chief cauſe that this appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemeth to follow, or go before men, is by reaſon of the motion of the Air, by the going or motion of the man before or after whom it thus goes. Which Air being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, drives it forward or backward, as it is either placed before or behind the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                        <p>Whence it will rationally follow, that it is not the fire that leads or drives the fool, but the fool the fire: but when this fire happens to be at a greater diſtance, the mans eye and the air moving, maketh the man to think the fire moves.</p>
                        <p>Theſe lights appear alſo oftentimes at
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:114880:84"/> Sea as well as at land; ſometimes one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſometimes two together; which ſome Seamen &amp; Mariners, alluding to the writings of the Poets, have given names unto; and call that which appears ſingle, <hi>Helena;</hi> and thoſe that appear together, <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi> But I ſhall not make any large diſcourſe of their names here, but refer the Reader to more voluminous treatiſes for ſatisfaction.</p>

                        <p>In the begining of this Treatiſe I have ſhewed what a wonderful Apparition or
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:114880:86"/> Prodigie is, according to the opinion and judgment of the beſt Philoſophers; and have treated there alſo of the ſeveral ſpecies or kinds of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Coeleſtial and Terreſtrial. It remaineth now, that I ſhew the chief cauſes of them, in this place. And if we adhere to our beſt Naturaliſts, they may be cauſed two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> naturally, and artificially.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, they may be cauſed artificially; as by certain Glaſſes and Inſtruments, made according to the ſecret knowledge of the Optiques; which teacheth by divers refractions and reflections of the beams, how moſt viſions and apparitions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Cornelius Agrippa,</hi> in the firſt Book and ſixth chapter of his <hi>Occult Philoſophy,</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, that by the artificialneſs of ſome Optical Glaſſes, ſome men may produce at a diſtance in the air whatſoever images or ſhapes they pleaſe. Which (ſaith he) when ignorant perſons behold, they think they ſee the appearance of Spirits, &amp;c. when indeed they are nothing elſe but ſemblances kin unto themſelves, and without life, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> Their own ſhadows contracted or dilated; which by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and friendſhip of the Optical
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114880:86"/> Glaſs, they have the happineſs to ſee, and the unhappineſs to think evilly of.</p>
                        <p>The ſame Author very excellently ſets forth the uſe of the Optiques by an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and not improbable inſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> Let any one (ſaith he) take an image or images, artificially painted, or written let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and in a clear night ſet them againſt the beams of the full Moon, whoſe reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance heing multiplyed in the Air, and caught upward, and reflected back toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the beams of the Moon, and any other man that is privy to the thing, at a long diſtance, ſees, reads, and knows them in the very compaſs and circle of the Moon.—Greater things then theſe <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> are grounded in the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Air, and have their reaſons and cauſes demonſtrated in the Mathematiques and Optiques.</p>
                        <p>The learned Author of that lofty Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical phancy (entituled <hi>The ſpeedy Meſſenger</hi>) who paſſeth under the name of <hi>Domingo Gonzales, fol.</hi> 20, 21. conſenteth to the learned <hi>Agrippa</hi> in this particular. And although his book be of a very faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and moſt pleaſant ſtile, yet undoubtedly the Author's aim was at ſomewhat more admirable and excellent, then the ordinary
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:114880:87"/> ſence of his language makes known; as may eaſily be gathered by an ingenious underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Bodine, Theat. Nat. Lib.</hi> 2. is of opinion, that ſuch things as theſe cannot be cauſed but by the illuſions of evil ſpirits and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; And that they alone can repreſent Caſtles in the air, Armies, Cities, Palaces, <hi>Spectrum,</hi> and all kinds of wonderful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies and apparitions. But moſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers laugh at this his opinion, and deem it ridiculous.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, they may be cauſed naturally; and are ſo for the moſt part, <hi>viz.</hi> when the temper and diſpoſition of the air is ſuffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>iently able to receive the impreſs or image of thoſe things done on the earth. And becauſe the air is apt to receive divers images and ſhapes in divers parts or places thereof; thoſe monſtrous forms, and ſtrange actions, and ſtories, and characters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proceed f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>om the joyning of divers forms and actions there.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> that the effigies of all ſorts of bodies, may by the ſtrength of nature, in a temperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moiſt air, be eaſily repreſented.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> relates of a man unto whom it hapned, by reaſon of the weakneſs
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114880:87"/> of his ſight, the air which was neer him, became as a Looking-Glaſs to him; and the optique beam did reflect back upon himſelf, and could not penetrate the Air: ſo that whitherſoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e went, he thought he ſaw his own image, with his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, go juſt before him.</p>
                        <p>And <hi>Agrippa</hi> ſaith, When the air by the South-wind is condenſed into thin clouds, there are repreſented as in a Look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Glaſs, at a great diſtance, Mountains, Caſtles, Horſes, and men, and divers other things. Which when the clouds diſſipate, the apparitions vaniſh, and diſappear.</p>
                        <p>This generally is the Opinion of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors concerning the cauſes of Meteors and wonderful apparitions. And for Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors, they are by experience generally found true, and therefore not to be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned or ſuſpected. And for wonderful Apparitions and Prodigies, it is more then probable they are alſo true: But</p>
                        <p>This Tractate ſwelling ſomewhat above the banks of my intentions, cauſes me to pretermit the giving an account of the natural cauſes of Lightning and Thunder,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114880:88"/> Mock-Suns and Mock-Moons Circles and Crowns, &amp;c. But theſe things being more ordinarily known then thoſe I have treated of, I preſume the ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will not think it amiſs to be referred to his own common experience for the knowledge of them.</p>

                        <p>This <hi>Trithemius</hi> was an Abbot in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> and (without all peradventure) a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114880:91"/> perſon moſt eminently learned: And he being deſirous to fly or ſoar ſomewhat above the ordinary Pitch, writes a Book of the heavenly Intelligences governing the Orbs under God. (Which Book he dedicates to the Emperor.) But he writes in ſo ambiguous a ſtrain, that the ſubject matter thereof for verity, doth appear to an eaſie underſtanding ſuſpitious. — For (ſaith he) <hi>Many learned men have conſented to this Doctrine; which opinion of their's, my ſelf NOT AFFIRM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING, but delivering, do make manifeſt to your moſt ſacred Majeſty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And at his laſt farewel (that you may ſee he writ what he writ, for Fame and Honour, more then for any belief he had of the thing) he concludes — <hi>Moſt ſacred Caeſar! I have not wrote theſe things aſſertively, or that we muſt believe them by any means. — I proteſt with my own proper hand, and confeſs with my mouth, that in all theſe things delivered, I BELIEVE NOTHING, or admit of ANY THING, unleſs what the Church doth hold: the reſt, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute, and contemn as vain, fained and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thus far <hi>Trithemius</hi> himſelf. And would
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114880:92"/> any man, that is but reaſonable, and well in his wits, engage his faith or belief unto that, which the Author thereof profeſſeth to refute and contemn, as vain, feigned and Superſtitious?</p>
                        <p>Beſides, if this his doctrine of Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were certain and true, and not ſuperſtitious, vain and faigned; how ſhould it come to paſs that his own diſciples jar and diſagree in their own craft and skill? One of them tells us, — <hi>That the world is now under the Gubernation of Gabriel, the Angel or Spirit of Mercury; and ſaith it is—perhaps a ſign we are afflicted with ſo many novel opinions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Vide Lil. worl.

Another of them acquaints us (from long poring and ſtaring upon the ſame fictitious principles) <hi>That the world is not (now) under the government of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel, the Angel of Mercury, but Hanael</hi> [names to fright folks, rather then feed their underſtanding!] <hi>the Angel or Spirit of Venus.

                        <p>Again, if there were any verity or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this high-towring doctrine they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, may we nor with much reaſon conclude both theſe <hi>[Angel-mongers]</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken? for according to the Principles of their Patron <hi>Trithemius,</hi> neither <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> nor <hi>Hanael;</hi> but <hi>Samael</hi> the Angel or Spirit of <hi>Mars</hi> (to cope with them in their own canting dialect) ſhould have ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this preſent Age of the world.

                        <p>But when <hi>raſh Aſſertors</hi> want argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of reaſon to make good the things they (ſo ignorantly) obtrude upon mens underſtandings, it is no wonder that they are found guilty of ſuch groſs abſurdities.

                        <p>By this ſhort Annotation, you may judge of what worth and excellency the whole is, although ſo prodigiouſly boaſted of. For you ſee plainly, <hi>Trithemius</hi> owns not the doctrine; and it is plainly to be ſeen alſo, that <hi>his diſciples</hi> underſtand it not; nor
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114880:93"/> indeed do they know how to make uſe thereof, except only to gild over their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in honeſt and demonſtrable Arts they pretend to the knowledg of.</p>
                        <p>It ſeemeth as cleer to me, as the <hi>Sun</hi> in his Meridian glory, that <hi>Trithemius</hi> his deſign and aim was to get himſelf <hi>fame and honor;</hi> and to fix the <hi>Image of his ambition</hi> in the beliefs and underſtandings of the ignorant and credulous ſort of people in the world; ſo to perpetuate his name and memory for ever, by ſuch an undertaking. <hi>[For you muſt know, that the world is not half ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of perſons ignorant, as ingenious; and really I account it a providence, that God and Nature have given to wit and ingenuity wings, that the Heavenly part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly learned, may bear them up above the dunſtable reſolutions of the ruſtick or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned: otherwiſe, they would be moſt ſure to be voted out of their knowledge, as reaſon it ſelf too often is, at a Grand-Jury.]</hi> It is not to be doubted, but <hi>Trithemius</hi> knew the vanity and fictitiouſneſs of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Angel-skill. But had not <hi>Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> done ſomething above the ordinary level, how ſhould he have (now) been talked of among us? he (alas!) hath paſſed away, and would have been remembred

Now the better to obtrude this his fancy upon the ſpirit of the world, <hi>he dedicates the ſtory to Caeſar;</hi> ſubmitting to his judgment, and the cenſure of the Church therein. And hence it is come to paſs, <hi>that the learning of Trithemius, and the authority and greatneſs of Caeſar his Patron, hath born down as well the reaſon and judgment of ſome perſons very learned, as the yeilding brains of the ignorant.</hi> And thus much for <hi>Trithemius.</hi>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:114880:102"/> to have related Prophetically other very ſtrange things. Without injury to reaſon, we may believe, they were a company of poor Melancholy creatures, that knew not what themſelves ſpake. Some of them (as it is reported) would write their fancies in ſand; others, at the mouth of a cave in leaves of trees: which the fierceneſs of the wind would oftentimes ſo ſcatter, that they could hardly be brought into order again. Whence it was, when people were wont to expreſs any difficulty, they would uſe <hi>Politian</hi>'s words — <hi>Laborioſus eſt, quàm Sibyllae folia colligere: It is eaſier to gather together the Sibylls Leaves. Rom. Ant. fol.</hi> 52. Now, let us ask of reaſon, whether ſuch actions as theſe are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Teſtimonies of Melancholy? yet ſo credulous have many learned (as well as others) been, that when they would aſſert the reality and truth of any thing, they would do it proverbially in theſe words— <hi>'Tis as true as the Sibylls Oracles!</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The learned Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> of <hi>C.C.C. Oxon,</hi> ſaith, <hi>that Melancholy was the ſole cauſe of Sibylline Prophecies, if there were any ſuch thing.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114880:103"/> reveal ſuch manifeſt Revelations and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of Chriſt, and conceal them from his own Prophets. <hi>Anat. Mel. fol.</hi> 657.

And really, for any man to credit, or give heed to vain, idle, and addle-headed women, and to eſteem their Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or twarling ſtories, as prophecies, or Oracles, Is the greateſt Argument of Imbecility or weakneſs, that can be.</p>
                        <p>For my ſelf, I will ſpeak freely; my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon knows no difference betwixt a <hi>Sibylls</hi> Oracle, and a ſilly Quakers conceited Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation! And if we muſt ſtill be born down with the empty names of ſuch like fictions and fopperies, I underſtand not, but we may, with as much reaſon, credit the voices and Revelations of <hi>Hannah Trapnel,</hi> and <hi>Dorcas Erbury:</hi> the parallel ſeems equal. For the Sibylls in their times pretented to deliver their fantaſms by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration; ſo do theſe ſilly wretches. The Sibyls were ſcorn'd and contemn'd in their days; which occaſioned their living in
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:114880:103"/> caves and other obſcure places: the like are theſe poor ſilly ſouls ſubject unto. And if it be only the length of time, that can make every melancholy, diſtemper'd, crack-brain'd Creature a Prophet, or Propheteſs, I know nor, but thoſe ſilly poor Creatures (though now deſpicable) at length may be eſteemed of equal Authority with the <hi>Sibylls.</hi>

It captivates the ſenſes, deſtroys reaſon, makes every thing ſeem of a quite contrary hew. It hath cauſed men to conceit themſelves Urinals, Sheep, Horſes, any thing. Some by reaſon thereof, have believed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be dead; others, to want a head; a third ſort, to have ſerpents in their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and what not? when alas! there is no ſuch thing, ſave in their Melancholy conceits. But as the learned <hi>Gregory</hi> well notes of ſuch that are vertiginous—<hi>They think all turns round, all erre; quum error in ipſorum cerebro ſit; When the error is only in their own brains:</hi> So it is with theſe melancholy perſons. And this may ſuffice to ſignifie the error of the Sibylls, Quakers, Dreamers, and the reſt of that rabble, and of thoſe that believe or give credit to them, or their conceits.</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:114880:104"/> to be ſo deluded, cheated and cozened, as hath been ſhewn, is no great marvel; but for the learned and ingenious to be found in the ſame predicament, is (to me) no ſmall wonder!</p>
                        <p>This eminently learned perſon (for whithout queſtion ſuch he was, as appears ſufficiently by his <hi>Mathematical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to Euclid,</hi> &amp; his Aphoriſms; two things of ſuch worth, that (in kind) I cannot tell what extant can equal,) as is evident by the book lately ſet forth by <hi>Meric Caſaubon D. D.</hi> under his name, was a great Creditor of the Doctrine of Spirits and Angels; and had (if the book ſay ſooth, which I not a little queſtion) Communication and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with them. But yet he confeſſeth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have ſeen any himſelf; but was ſtill beholden either to Mr. <hi>Kelly, Arthur,</hi> or <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> his ſpeculators by turns; and whatſoever they told him, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to reſt ſatisfied therewith.</p>
                        <p>It is the opinion of Dr. <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> that Dr. <hi>Dee</hi>'s aim and deſign was to bring up a new Mode of Religion among men (we have now too many of them, withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114880:105"/> was his aim and intent ſo to do; and will it not readily reſult, that there was not ſo much of truth or reality, as ſubtilty &amp; policy in the thing? Another thing worthy of good conſideration, I meet with in the Publiſher thereof— <hi>That had Dr.</hi> Dee <hi>but lived in Turkie when he converſed with Angels and Spirits thus, there is no doubt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but they would have ſpoke as much for the Mahome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </p>
                        <p>And indeed if we ſeriouſly conſider this Doctrine, &amp;c. we ſhall finde, that both Angels and Spirits, &amp;c. always fitted their Anſwers and Oracles to the humors and cuſtomes of the times, and place or places in which they were delivered. Which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing proclaims the whole buſineſs to conſiſt of nothing b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:114880:105"/> Scripture-language; the ſtile Platonick; and of ſo indifferent a vein for eloquence and fancie, That I preſume an ordinary wit might have flown a far higher pitch. <hi>Ben. Johnſons Bartholomew Fair</hi> is far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it, both for language and matter, plot and contrivance; and indeed, in all other reſpects.</p>
                        <p>There is one thing in it (above all the reſt) worthy to be noted; and plainly proves the deſigners of this new-found Whimſey, not ſo religious as they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. It is this — <hi>In the progreſs of theſe Stories, Dr.</hi> Dee <hi>and Mr.</hi> Kelly <hi>could ſeldome agree. At laſt they reſolved to invocate an Angel or Spirit, to acquaint them with the reaſon thereof, they being of one and the ſame faith, and profeſſing and practiſing one and the ſame thing.</hi> To be brief, an Angel (as ſaith the Book) was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the queſtion being propounded,—The Angel returned this in anſwer—<hi>The reaſon of their diſagreeing ſo much was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not croſs matched.</hi> Upon the hearing of this anſwer from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> and <hi>Kelly</hi> begin to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the ſame, <hi>To their not having layen with each others wife.</hi> And this was the beſt and only gloſs they could put upon
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:114880:106"/> their Angels anſwer. Now to put this bleſſed work into practiſe, <hi>To tempting the women they go; And</hi> (ſayes the Book) <hi>the women cryed thereat, deeming the action ſinful.</hi> And that which is the more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, To theſe Lecherous and filthy conceits, they were not aſhamed to abuſe the holy and glorious name of God and of the Trinity.</p>
                        <p>Immediately after, to render the cheat (for no other can it be, notwithſtanding ſome account it of as good a ſtamp for truth, as the Goſpel of <hi>St. John</hi>) the more plain and clear; they ſubjoyn a queſtion of Theft, anſwered by Aſtrologie, and the very text of <hi>Haly de judic. Aſtr.</hi> urged for the reaſon of their judgment. Which had there been any thing of excellencie or certainty in their pretended Doctrine of Angels, I ſuppoſe they would never have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to poor <hi>Haly;</hi> or have craved the aſſiſtance of an Aphoriſm from him in any caſe whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>In another place, they fall to their trade of Exorciſing again; and an unmannerly ſhee-Angel appears, and incontinently ſhews them her nakedneſs. Such is the excellencie and Religion of ſuch Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical fooleries!</p>
                        <pb n="197" facs="tcp:114880:106"/>
                        <p>What this <hi>Kelly</hi> was, the Publiſher tells you at large, that he was a Philoſopher un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by fire, or by ſeeking after the Elixir; (a thing that hath befooled the wiſeſt of men.) Afterwards he fell into ſome ill trade, or courſe of living, that (as the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher ſaith) he loſt his ears in <hi>Lancaſhire;</hi> and then fled beyond the Seas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for Dr. <hi>Dee</hi>'s part, I believe him much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed in the thing. For it is impoſſible for reaſon to conclude, a perſon of ſo great learning and parts, a general ſcholar, one that had the advantage of the beſt wits in his time, (which was of power ſufficient to keep his reaſon from ſinking, or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhipwrak) and himſelf ſo great a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in all arts and ſciences, could be ſo ſtrangely deluded.</p>
                        <p>If we ſhould admit that this <hi>Kelly</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as you have heard before, a perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a condition deſperate) might once by his ſubtiltie delude him; Or that himſelf (in ſome more then ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Mood) ſhould willingly yeild to the tryal of ſome ſuch project: Yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive, but he muſt eaſily have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the vanity and uncertainty, (to ſay no worſe) of the practiſe, before it could poſſibly grow up unto ſo large a book in <hi>folio.</hi>

                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:114880:107"/>
                        <p>I leave the modeſt Reader to judge of the thing. If it be falſly fathered upon Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> my eſtimate thereof is not then vain: if it be truly &amp; really his own, I <hi>then account it no miracle for vain and fooliſh things to confound and deſtroy the wiſdom, judgments, and underſtanding of the wiſe.</hi> Thus much for the ſubſtance and excellence of Dr. <hi>Dee,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Kelly,</hi> in their large <hi>folio</hi> Book of Spirits, lately publiſhed.</p>

                        <p>The learned Frenchman <hi>James Gafferel, fol.</hi> 285. tells us, <hi>That the Aſtrologie of the Hebrewes had not as yet loſt any of its luſtre, ſo long as it was practiſed by thoſe of their own Nation only. But ſo ſoon as the more Northern Nations began to have any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, they preſently fell to venting of ſuch ſtrange, wilde fancies, and to increaſe the number of fables in ſuch ſort, as that it is no marvel that the Science hath been ſo much cry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:114880:107"/>
                        <p>In the number or retinue of which vanities, I rank the Prophecies now in queſtion. Where in pag. 1. our Prophet tells us,—That <hi>Elphin</hi> ſon of <hi>Gwidduo Garranir</hi> having requeſted the benefit of fiſhing for one night, which being grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by his father, he riſes early the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and taking up his net, finds no fiſh therein; but (inſtead thereof) eſpyes entangled about the Net, a cloſe leather bag, the which he took up and ripped open, and found a child therein named [I know not, nor he neither, by whom] <hi>Talieſin.</hi> Pag. 2. this wonderful childe declares it ſelf for the Proteſtant Religion: Albeit <hi>Luther,</hi> the father thereof, was not born ſome centuries of years after. <hi>Elphin</hi> is grieved he hath miſſed his prize by fiſhing; <hi>Talieſin,</hi> pag. 3. promiſeth to be better to him then 300.
